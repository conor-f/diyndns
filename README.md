# DIYnDNS
My ISP wanted me to pay ten euro per month for a static IPv4 address. I also didn't want to use a normal dynamic DNS setup for some inexplicable reason.

This is a crude automatic updater of my DNS records whenever my public IP
address changes.


## TODO:
 - [ ] Make a blog post of all the pain that went into the Namecheap version
 - [ ] Make a `docker-compose` file for running it on a server
 - [ ] Make a `Makefile` with github actions to auto-deploy to dockerhub
